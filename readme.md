## üìã Clipboard Support & Dependencies
`findt` uses smart clipboard detection with multiple fallback methods for maximum compatibility.

### macOS  
‚úÖ Works out of the box using built-in `pbcopy`

### Windows  
‚úÖ Works out of the box using Windows clipboard API

### Linux  
‚ö†Ô∏è Install a clipboard utility for best experience:
```bash
sudo apt install xclip   # or
sudo apt install xsel
```

**Fallback:** If no clipboard support is available, file paths and content are printed to terminal instead.

## üéØ Search Modes

### Normal Mode (Default)
- **Zero dependencies** - works everywhere
- **Lightning fast** - instant substring matching
- **Reliable** - handles massive directories smoothly
- **Predictable** - shows exactly what contains your search term

### Fancy Mode (Optional)
- **Install:** `pip install rapidfuzz`
- **Fuzzy matching** - handles typos and partial matches
- **Smart scoring** - most relevant results first
- **Toggle anytime** - press `f` to switch modes

The beauty is you get a perfectly functional tool without any dependencies, but can enhance it when desired!

## üîç File Discovery

findt recursively discovers files in your directory with smart filtering:

- **Includes:** Text files, code files, documents, configs
- **Excludes:** Hidden directories (`.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`)
- **Progress:** Beautiful animated indexing screen for large directories
- **Memory-only:** No index files created - everything stays in RAM

---
## üí° Pro Tips

- **Large directories:** Normal mode handles even crazy large directories smoothly
- **Preview navigation:** Preview follows your file selection, not cursor movement  
- **Quick copying:** `c` for paths (great for terminal commands), `y` for content (great for pasting code)
- **Search as you type:** No need to press enter - results update in real-time
- **Vim users:** Familiar `j/k` navigation feels natural

---
## üêå Performance note (for the ambitious)

If you're crazy enough to run findt in your root directory, normal mode will handle it gracefully while fancy mode might slow down. The initial file discovery shows a progress screen so you're never left wondering if it's working.

Most people run this on project directories or ~/Documents anyway, where it's instant.

I've included both licenses with the repo, do what you know is right. The licensing works by assuming you're operating under good faith.
